# TRISAT-SDR — Multi-Band Software-Defined GNSS Receiver

`trisat_sdr/` is the cross-platform (**macOS, GNU/Linux, and Windows**) Software-Defined Radio (SDR) GNSS receiver of the **TRISAT** ecosystem, designed specifically to operate with **one or two synchronized HackRF One units** (as well as RTL-SDR, PlutoSDR, USRP via SoapySDR, or baseband IQ files) across the following bands:

* **Galileo E1B/C ($1575.42\text{ MHz}$, $\text{CBOC}(6,1,1/11)$):** PCPS acquisition, 5-correlator DLL/PLL tracking ($VE, E, P, L, VL$), **I/NAV** page demodulation ($250\text{ bps}$), **CRC-24Q** integrity verification, and extraction of the **40 cryptographic OSNMA bits (`HKROOT` + `MACK`)**.
* **Galileo E6B/C ($1278.75\text{ MHz}$, $\text{BPSK}(5)$):** **C/NAV** page demodulation ($1000\text{ sps}$) and extraction of **Galileo HAS (High Accuracy Service PPP)** centimeter-level orbit and clock corrections.
* **Galileo E5a ($1176.45\text{ MHz}$), E5b ($1207.14\text{ MHz}$), and E5 Full AltBOC(15,10) ($1191.795\text{ MHz}$):** Ionosphere-free ($\text{Iono-Free}$) dual-frequency combination with E1, alongside F/NAV and I/NAV demodulation.
* **GPS L1 C/A ($1575.42\text{ MHz}$, $\text{BPSK}(1)$):** Simultaneous acquisition and tracking on the same RF front-end as Galileo E1.

## 🔗 Dual-HackRF Hardware Interconnection (E1 + E6 / E5)

With **two HackRF One units**, you can simultaneously receive **Galileo E1 (OSNMA)** on the primary HackRF and **Galileo E6 (HAS)** or **Galileo E5** on the secondary HackRF while maintaining phase and clock coherence:

1. **Clock Synchronization (`10 MHz`):** Connect a short SMA coaxial cable from the **`CLKOUT`** port of **HackRF #0 (Master)** to the **`CLKIN`** port of **HackRF #1 (Slave)**.
2. **Active Antenna Powering (`Bias-T 3.3V`):** Connect your multi-band active GNSS antenna (L1/E1 + L5/E5 + E6) via an RF power splitter (with DC block on one branch) or use two active antennas. `TRISAT-SDR` automatically enables **Bias-T (`-b 1`)** on both HackRF units.

## 🚀 Running `TRISAT-SDR` (macOS / Linux / Windows)

No mandatory external dependencies are required to run (includes a pure Python radix-2 FFT engine and automatically accelerates with `NumPy`, `SoapySDR`, or `hackrf_transfer` when installed):

```bash
# 1. Start the Dual-SDR receiver + Interactive Web Dashboard (http://127.0.0.1:8085)
python3 trisat_sdr/main.py

# 2. Select the secondary HackRF band (GAL_E6, GAL_E5A, GAL_E5B, GAL_E5_ALTBOC)
python3 trisat_sdr/main.py --band2 GAL_E5_ALTBOC

# 3. Headless console mode streaming frames over UDP and TCP
python3 trisat_sdr/main.py --headless
```

---

The current SDR pipeline produces simulated navigation frames and positioning results. The dashboard, CLI and JSON telemetry identify them as simulated, and the OSNMA Annex A self-test is reported separately from any received-message verification. IQ-file input does not make downstream navigation results measured.

When using `SdrChannelConfig(driver="file", iq_file_path=..., iq_format=...)`, each stream reads a capture once from its first I/Q pair. Read sizes may vary. The last block can be shorter than requested, and later reads return an empty list. The reader discards an incomplete trailing pair and reports file access or format errors. Construct a new stream to replay from the beginning.

## 📡 Telemetry Bridge to TRISAT (`trisat_ios` / macOS / `trisat_android`)

`TRISAT-SDR` sends simulated frames and telemetry as JSON with `"source": "simulated"`. For a dedicated legacy test client, pass `--emit-legacy-simulation` to also send NMEA and custom navigation sentences. Legacy sentences have no provenance field, and GGA reports no real fix. Supported transports:
1. **UDP Server (`127.0.0.1:5005`)** and **TCP Server (`0.0.0.0:5006`)**
2. **POSIX virtual serial device (`PTY`) on macOS/Linux** can be allocated. Serial output is currently unavailable.
3. **Broadcast Frame Formats:**
   * `$GALINAV,<svid>,<wordType>,<hex30Bytes>,<osnmaHkroot><osnmaMack>*CS`
   * `$GALE6HAS,<svid>,<pageId>,<orbitCorrCm>,<hexPayload>*CS`
   * `$GALE5,<band>,<svid>,<pageType>,<hexPayload>*CS`
   * `$GNGGA`, `$GAGSV`, `$GPGSV`, and JSON objects compatible with the TRISAT BLE bridge.

The dashboard and `/api/status` separate generated lines from local socket writes. Each encoded line contributes to `bridge.messages_generated` and `bytes_generated` once. Each distinct UDP destination (the configured port and port 9090) or connected TCP client counts as one attempt. The `packets_sent` and `bytes_sent` totals count complete writes accepted by the local socket, summed across destinations. The `transports` breakdown reports attempts and accepted writes by channel. Delivery to the receiving application is unverified.

## Replay a Septentrio SBF capture

Open a local recording containing `GALRawINAV` blocks from the repository root:

```bash
python -m trisat_sdr.replay_sbf path/to/recording.sbf
```

Open the printed loopback URL, select a Galileo satellite, then play or step through its pages. Use `--port` to choose another port or `--jsonl` to export the same sequence as JSON lines. The viewer checks the SBF block CRC and displays the receiver-reported navigation CRC separately. It displays the recorded 234-bit pages and the GPS week/time of week. Only I/NAV is read into the viewer. The original recording remains local.

### Optional offline OSNMA verification

Install the dependencies of a local [OSNMAlib](https://github.com/Algafix/OSNMA) checkout into the Python environment used by TRISAT and make the checkout importable. This adapter was tested with Python 3.12 and OSNMAlib commit `25aa61de15ea0ffc0bf1bc62ff8214d5898e89e2`. Use trusted [Galileo key material](https://www.gsc-europa.eu/galileo/services/galileo-open-service-navigation-message-authentication-osnma/galileo-osnma-idd) appropriate to the date of the capture.

Example in PowerShell from the TRISAT checkout:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = 'C:\path\to\OSNMA'
python -m trisat_sdr.replay_sbf 'C:\path\to\recording.sbf' --merkle-tree 'C:\path\to\MerkleTree.xml' --public-key 'C:\path\to\PublicKey.xml'
```

Both XML files are required to enable verification. The viewer then shows verified-tag counts per target satellite, broken down by ADKD, as results become available in replay order. With `--jsonl`, the same result is included as `osnma_verification`. The verifier works offline and uses the capture timestamps. A verified tag applies to navigation data, while the CRC and position remain separate observations.
